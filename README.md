# Component Booster Kit

The purpose of this project is to enable rapid prototyping with pre-built components in combination with our
[React BoosterKit](https://github.com/spartansystems/booster-kit-react).

## Requirements

[Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)

```bash
# via homebrew
brew install yarn
```

## Features

Nothing yet!

## Roadmap

The goal is to be able to yarn install this package and have access to all the components here through some simple
generator scripts, inspired by [Thoughtbot's wonderful Refills library](https://github.com/thoughtbot/refills)

## Contribution Guidelines

* Be nice. Have fun. Get productive. Make *very* cool things!

* Please enable linting on your local machine, PR's that do not pass the linter
  will not be merged

* Each component must be unit tested and well documented.

* Right now, we're using css modules.

* A story file for each component is also required so that all the components
  are available for demo in the local storybook.

* When creating a new component for the library, use one of the included
  generators:
  - `yarn run generate:component ComponentName`

## Common Commands

```bash
# get set up
yarn install

# run tests
yarn run test

# run tests and watch
yarn run test -- --watch

# start the storybook server
yarn start

# run flow
yarn run flow
```

## Component Naming Conventions

Sometimes you end up with a ton of components and they become unruly and hard to find. Keeping them named and organized
will speed up your ability to find exactly what it is you are looking for. As a recommendation for combatting this
conundrum, here is a quick and easy way to name your components; we will have three categories:

1. **Site Wide Components**
  - The best examples to demonstrate site wide components are the site header and footer. Here is how we suggest naming:
  - *SiteHeader*, *SiteFooter*
  - Simply prepend the component name with "Site" if it meets the requirements.
2. **Section Container Components**
  - These components are essentially wrappers for content. Pass props to them for background colors, box model,
  margins, etc. Here's a couple examples:
  - *SectionFullWidth*, *SectionContainer*, etc.
  - Simply prepend the component name with "Section" if it meets the requirements.
3. **Content Components**
  - These components are where 99% of content will live. You can nest them inside of Section Container Components to
  prevent extra code from being written. Here's a couple examples:
  - *ContentImage*, *ContentFullWidthText*, *ContentQuote*, etc.

By following the above recommendations, your *Components* directory will be nice and organized by component type and then
alphabetically within there. If this isn't your jam, then do what feels right â€” just make sure your naming conventions
are easy enough to understand that you can hand them off to another without a taking a ton of time to explain where and why everything is located.

## Component Markup Guidelines

To standardize the way are components are created for maximum reusability, try and stick as close to the following list
of recommendations when creating and contributing a new component to the component library.

### Keeping Components Atomic, Semantic & Accessible

* Keep in mind that components are **reusable packages** of code that allow multiple types of data to be entered easily.
* Please refer to [Atomic Design by Brad Frost](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/) for a deeper dive
into Atomic Design philosophies, methodologies and how tos.
* When writing the HTML portion of a component, keep in mind the elements you are using. There are a lot of them. Check
out [The Periodic Table of HTML Elements by Josh Duck](http://zqsmm.qiniucdn.com/data/20110511083224/index.html) for a
comprehensive list of all the available HTML elements and when and where to use them.
* Accessibility concerns for the handicap often are overlooked when writing HTML because the aria spec is still quite new.
Try and include any and all accessibility and landmark roles on all appropriate elements in your markup. For more
information on the aria spec, and accessibility in general, check out that A11Y Project](http://a11yproject.com/).
